      <status value="additional"/><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>What Skilarence is</b></p><p>Skilarence is a medicine that contains the active substance dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate works on cells of the immune system (the body's natural defences). It changes the activity of the immune system and reduces the production of substances involved in causing psoriasis.</p><p><b>What Skilarence is used for</b></p><p>Skilarence tablets are used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Psoriasis is a disease causing thickened, inflamed, red areas on the skin, often covered by silvery scales.</p><p>Response to Skilarence can be generally seen as early as week 3 and improves over time. Experience with related products containing dimethyl fumarate shows treatment benefit for at least up to 24 months.</p></div>

Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p><p><b>Dose</b></p><p>Your doctor will start your treatment with a low dose (using 30 mg Skilarence tablets).

After your condition has improved sufficiently, your doctor will consider how to gradually reduce the daily dose of Skilarence to what you need to maintain your improvement.</p><p><b>Method of administration</b></p><p>Swallow Skilarence tablets whole with liquid. Take your tablets during or immediately after a meal. Do not crush, break, dissolve or chew your tablets, as they have a special coating to help prevent irritation of your stomach.</p><p><b>If you take more Skilarence than you should</b></p><p>If you think you have taken too many Skilarence tablets, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p><b>If you forget to take Skilarence</b></p><p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
