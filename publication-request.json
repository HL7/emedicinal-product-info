  "category" : "Pharmaceutical",
  "introduction" : "This Guide defines a set of FHIR profiles that will allow for the creation and exchange of electronic Product Information (ePI) documents. This guide is primarily meant for developers of structured content authoring solutions; medicinal product manufacturers who author ePI documents; the national competent authorities who review and authorize ePI documents; and consumers of the ePI document’s content (e.g., eHealth developers or service providers). A medicine’s product information is a pivotal source of regulated and scientifically validated information. Transitioning the ePI to FHIR format will make medicinal product information more available for use in systems or services that (1) assist healthcare professionals in prescribing and dispensing medicines; and (2) inform consumers about the safe use of their medicines."
