Step 1
Make alignment between the regulator, industry, other stakeholders (HCP first (e.g., pharmacist association), then patients)

Step 2
Choose use case(s)
	1. Central ePI website
		a. Regulator site, Company site, or third party site
		b. How do they upgrade from PDF version and then update to FHIR version?
		c. How to add advanced search to a central ePI website
	2. eHealth interoperability
		a. Personalization in connection with EHR and health apps. E.g., Interactions, Contraindications, and allergies
		b. Cross-border travel
	3. Drug shortage
	4. Distribution (e.g., stock management, GTIN)

Step 3
	• Decide the ePI Type (1, 2, 3, 4)
	• Recommend Type 2 as the starting point before adding support for Type 3

Step 4
	• Decide what controlled vocabularies and identifiers need to be supported for the ePI Type selected in Step 3.

Step 5
	• Design ePI sample based on the local template and with the selected controlled vocabularies
		○ If no local template exists recommend creating a national template
	• Update the local or regional implementation guide to describe the ePI sample and its controlled vocabularies
	• Gather feedback on the sample, controlled vocabularies, and IG from stakeholders
	• Update ePI sample, controlled vocabularies, and IG based on stakeholder feedback
	• Define the local style sheet 
		○ Gather feedback from HCPs and patients on how they would like to see the style ePI content

Step 6
	• Procure systems (align with Vulcan business case content)
		○ Structured Authoring tool (This should include style sheets)
		○ Database
		○ Website (This should include style sheets)
		○ APIs
		○ Standardized international health app (like KC's Netflix idea) or a national health app

Step 7
	1. Implementation
		a. Technical pilot - small scale (Voluntary)
		b. Production pilot - small scale (Voluntary)
		c. Production - full scale (Voluntary)
		d. Production - full scale (Mandatory)
	• Receive stakeholder feedback after each implementation step and adjust before beginning the next step
		○ Reduce complexity
		○ Publish communications
		○ Publish results of each implementation stage
