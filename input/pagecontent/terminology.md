Controlled terminology ensures consistency, interoperability, and regulatory compliance across digital drug labels, supporting global harmonization of medicinal product information.

### Introduction to Controlled Terminology

Standardized code systems allow drug label information to be precise and machine-readable. In the ePI IG, these terminologies facilitate integration with systems like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and ePrescribing apps.

> [!TIP]
> **Clinical Precision**: **SNOMED CT**, **ICD**, and **MedDRA** are used for indications, contraindications, and adverse reactions, ensuring that clinical content is universally understood by medical software globally.

### Key Terminologies Used

| Standard      | Usage in ePI                                          |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **LOINC**     | Document and section codes (e.g., SmPC, PIL headings) |
| **UCUM**      | Standardized units of measure for dosages             |
| **ISO 639-1** | Two-letter language codes (e.g., "en", "fr")          |
| **EDQM**      | Dose forms, routes of administration, and packaging   |
| **MedDRA**    | Adverse event and safety reporting codes              |

### International Harmonization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Cross-Border Reciprocity**: By using **EDQM** and **SNOMED CT**, a single ePI Type 2 or 3 document can be understood and processed by healthcare systems in multiple jurisdictions with minimal adaptation.
