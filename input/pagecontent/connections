### How to connect IPS and ePI resources
The following identifiers are used as connection points between the IPS bundle, the ePI Master List and the ePI document (e.g., PIL or SmPC).

**Market Authorization Number (MAN)**
A marketing authorisation number is used to uniquely identify a medicinal product. it is allocated to a specific strength and pharmaceutical form of the medicinal product.

The marketing authorisation number, assigned by the European Medicines Agency to a centrally authorised medicinal product, indicates whether it is a product for human or veterinary use, the year of authorisation of the first presentation of the product, the sequence number of the authorisation of the first presentation of the product and the number distinguishing subsequently authorised presentations of the product (pharmaceutical form, strength, pack size and type of packaging). It has the following format: EU/A/BB/CCC/DDD:

EU – identification of a centrally authorised medicinal product

A – distinction of the medicinal product (1 – human medicine, 2 – veterinary medicine)

BB – year of authorisation

CCC – serial number of the authorisation

DDD – number of the product presentation

This type of the marketing authorisation number allows for the tracing of links between individual product presentations assigned to the global authorisation; however, it does not allow for the distinguishing of the year in which the individual presentations were authorised, and it does not even indicatively point to the therapeutic area of the use of the product.

 

The marketing authorisation number of a product which is subject to parallel distribution, comprises of the marketing authorisation number of a centrally authorised medicinal product complemented with the letters “PD”, meaning parallel distribution, the sequential number of the parallel distribution authorisation in the respective year, and the year of issuance of such authorisation; prior to 1 January 2017, the letters “PD” were complemented with the sequential number of the parallel distribution authorisation issued for the concerned medicinal product and the year of issuance of the parallel distribution authorisation. The data after the letters PD serve solely for the Institute’s internal purposes, they do not form part of the marketing authorisation number and in the search database they are provided on a separate line under the marketing authorisation number.
