Maria is a 75 year old Norwegian woman, on two prescription medications (medicinal product #1 and medicinal product #2). She lives with her husband in their home, and uses glasses, hearing aid and a walker when she is outside. Maria uses mobile phone apps to help make it is easier to manage her medications (e.g., what to take, when, and when to refill).

While travelling in Cyprus, a Cypriot pharmacy/HCP recommends an Over the Counter (OTC) medication for her hay fever.

Maria needs to show the Greek/Cypriot pharmacist/HCP a list of her current medications. Her list is in Norwegian but the Cypriot pharmacist needs it in Greek or English.

**Objectives of this example use case:**
1. Find Maria's IPS and extract (a)the name and unique IDs of her two prescribed medications; and (b) a list of what she is allergic to.  
2. Find the Patient Information Leaflets (in Norwegian, Greek and English) for the two prescribed medications using their name or IDs.
3. Use information from the IPS and ePI to keep Maria informed and safe.

**Scenario 1 - Find and display Patient Information Leaflet**

Technical Actions:
1. Acquire endpoint for FHIR server with IPS documents
2. Find Maria's IPS instance using her unique ID
3. Review Medication Summary section of Maria's IPS
4. Acquire list of Maria's active medications (i.e., product name and products unique ID)
5. Acquire endpoint for FHIR server with ePI documents
6. Find available ePI documents for Maria's active medications
7. Find Patient Information Leaflets for Maria's active medications
