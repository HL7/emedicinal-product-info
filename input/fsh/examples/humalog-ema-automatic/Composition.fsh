<p>You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your
blood. Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. It
works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin (2 to 5 hours). You should normally
use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin
comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless
your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin.</p>
<p>Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children.</p>         </div>"""

<p><strong>Do NOT use Humalog Mix50</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting. Further in this leaflet it tells you how to
deal with mild hypoglycaemia (see Section 3: If you take more Humalog Mix50 than you need).</li>
<li>if you are allergic to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warnings and precautions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you get
it from your pharmacy. Make sure you get the Humalog Mix50 that your doctor has told you to
use.</li>
<li>If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the
warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this
leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood
glucose often.</li>
<li>A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin
have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have
hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor.</li>
<li>If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes
nurse<ul>
<li>Have you recently become ill?</li>
<li>Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver?</li>
<li>Are you exercising more than usual?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol.</li>
<li>You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad.
The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals
at different times from when you are at home.</li>
<li>Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke
who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure.
Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual
shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skin changes at the injection site</strong></p>
<p>The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix50). Contact
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area.
Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose.</p>
<p><strong>Other medicines and Humalog Mix50</strong></p>
<p>Your insulin needs may change if you are taking</p>
<ul>
<li>the contraceptive pill,</li>
<li>steroids,</li>
<li>thyroid hormone replacement therapy,</li>
<li>oral hypoglycaemics,</li>
<li>acetyl salicylic acid,</li>
<li>sulpha antibiotics,</li>
<li>octreotide,</li>
<li>“beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),</li>
<li>beta-blockers, or</li>
<li>some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),</li>
<li>danazol,</li>
<li>some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and</li>
<li>angiotensin II receptor blockers.
Please tell your doctor, if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines,
including medicines obtained without a prescription (see section “Warnings and precautions”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</strong></p>
<p>Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, or are you breast-feeding? The amount of
insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the
remaining six months. If you are breast-feeding, you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet.
Ask your doctor for advice.</p>
<p><strong>Driving and using machines</strong></p>
<p>Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia. Please keep this
possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving
a car or operating machinery). You should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you
have: </p>
<ul>
<li>frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia</li>
<li>reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia
Humalog Mix50 contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.</li>

<b>3. How to use Humalog Mix50</b>
<p><strong>Dose</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You should normally inject Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you
can inject soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use,
when to use it, and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and
visit your diabetes clinic regularly.</li>
<li>If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a
Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the
first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.</li>
<li>Inject Humalog Mix50 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different
administration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparing Humalog Mix50</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cartridges containing Humalog Mix50 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times
and inverted 180° ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears
uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed.
Cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing. Do not shake vigorously as this may
cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges
should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if
solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance.
Check each time you inject yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Getting the pen ready to use</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge.</li>
<li>You must only use Humalog Mix50 cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that
Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The
3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen.</li>
<li>You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the
side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the
injection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. There
may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is
too big, it may make the dose of your injection less accurate.
Injecting Humalog Mix50</li>
<li>Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the
skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle
in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area
you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection
and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After injecting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap.
This will keep the Humalog Mix50 sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back
into the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen.
Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further injections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing
up until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is
left by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the
gauge is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog Mix50 cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not
use it again. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you should</strong>
If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low
blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar.</p>
<p>If your blood sugar is low (<strong>mild hypoglycaemia</strong>), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink.
Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will
often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your
breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat
quite severe hypoglycaemia. Eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection. If you do not respond to
glucagon, you will have to go to hospital. Ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon.</p>
<p><strong>If you forget to use Humalog Mix50</strong></p>
<p>If you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a high
blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar</p>
<p>If hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) is not treated they can be
very serious and cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness, coma or even
death (see A and B in section 4 “Possible Side Effects”).</p>
<p><strong>Three simple steps</strong> to avoid hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always keep a spare pen and cartridges, in case you lose your pen or cartridges or they get
damaged.</li>
<li>Always carry something to show you are diabetic.</li>
<li>Always carry sugar with you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you stop using Humalog Mix50.</strong></p>
<p>If you take less Humalog Mix50 than you need, a high blood sugar may occur. Do not change your
insulin unless your doctor tells you to.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist</p></div>"""

Systemic allergy is rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000). The symptoms are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>rash over the whole body</li>
<li>blood pressure dropping</li>
<li>difficulty in breathing </li>
<li>heart beating fast</li>
<li>wheezing </li>
<li>sweating</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you are having this sort of insulin allergy with Humalog, tell your doctor at once.</p>
<p>Local allergy is common (≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10). Some people get redness, swelling or itching around the
area of the insulin injection. This usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks. If this
happens to you, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Lipodystrophy is uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100). If you inject insulin too often at the same place,
the fatty tissue may either shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy). Lumps under the skin
may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis). The insulin may
not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help
prevent these skin changes.</p>
<p>Oedema (e.g. swelling in arms, ankles; fluid retention) has been reported, particularly at the start of
insulin therapy or during a change in therapy to improve control of your blood glucose.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting of side effects</strong></p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of
this medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Common problems of diabetes</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Hypoglycaemia</strong></p>
<p>Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means there is not enough sugar in the blood. This can be caused if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you take too much Humalog or other insulin;</li>
<li>you miss or delay meals or change your diet;</li>
<li>you exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal;</li>
<li>you have an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting);</li>
<li>there is a change in your need for insulin; or</li>
<li>you have trouble with your kidneys or liver which gets worse.
Alcohol and some medicines can affect your blood sugar levels.
The first symptoms of low blood sugar usually come on quickly and include the following:</li>
<li>tiredness </li>
<li>rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>nervousness or shakiness</li>
<li>feeling sick</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>cold sweat.
While you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations, e.g. driving a
car, in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B. Hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis</strong></p>
<p>Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) means that your body does not have enough insulin.
Hyperglycaemia can be brought about by:</p>
<ul>
<li>not taking your Humalog or other insulin;</li>
<li>taking less insulin than your doctor tells you to;</li>
<li>eating a lot more than your diet allows; or</li>
<li>fever, infection or emotional stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. The first symptoms come on slowly over many
hours or days. The symptoms include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling sleepy </li>
<li>no appetite</li>
<li>flushed face</li>
<li>fruity smell on the breath</li>
<li>thirst</li>
<li>feeling or being sick
Severe symptoms are heavy breathing and a rapid pulse. <strong>Get medical help immediately.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Illness</strong></p>
<p>If you are ill, especially if you feel sick or are sick, the amount of insulin you need may change. Even
when you are not eating normally, you still need insulin. Test your urine or blood, follow your
‘sick rules’, and tell your doctor.</p>         </div>"""
