<b>2. What you need to know before you take Monuril</b>
<p><b>Do not take Monuril if you:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>are allergic to fosfomycin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</li>
</ul>
<b>Warnings and precautions</b>
<br>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Monuril if you suffer from one of the following disorders:
<ul>
	<li> persistent infections of the bladder, </li>
	<li> previously had diarrhea after taking any other antibiotics. </li>
</ul>
<p><u>Conditions you need to look out for</u>
<br>Monuril can cause serious side effects. These include allergic reactions and an inflammation of the large intestine. You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking this medicine, to reduce the risk of any problems. See “Serious side effects” in Section 4.
<p><b>Children and adolescents</b>
<br>Do not give this medicine to children less than 12 years of age, as its safety and efficacy have not been established in this age group.
<p><b>Other medicines and Monuril</b>
<br>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
<br>This is especially important if you are taking:
<ul>
  <li><b>metoclopramide</b> or other medicinal products that increase the movement of food through the stomach and intestines, because they may reduce the uptake of fosfomycin by your body,</li>
  <li><b>anticoagulants</b>, as their ability to prevent your blood from clotting might be altered by fosfomycin and other antibiotics.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Monuril with food</b>
<br>Food may delay the absorption of fosfomycin. Therefore, this medicinal product should be taken on an empty stomach (2-3 hours before or 2-3 hours after a meal).
<p><b>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility</b>
<br>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
<p>If you are pregnant your doctor will only give you this medicine when it is clearly needed.
<p>Breast-feeding mothers can take a single oral dose of this medicine.
<p><b>Driving and using machines</b>
<br>You may experience side effects, such as dizziness, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.
<p><b>Monuril contains</b><br>
<u>Sodium</u><br>
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
<u>Sucrose</u><br>
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
<u>Sulphites</u><br>
