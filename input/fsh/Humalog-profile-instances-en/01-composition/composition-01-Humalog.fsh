<b>6. Contents of the pack and other information</b>
<b>What Humalog Mix50 100 units/ml suspension for injection in cartridge contains</b>
<p>The active substance is insulin lispro. Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant
DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other
human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural
hormone made by the pancreas.
The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium
phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid
may have been used to adjust the acidity.</p>
