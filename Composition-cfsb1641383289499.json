Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the acidity.</p></div>"
