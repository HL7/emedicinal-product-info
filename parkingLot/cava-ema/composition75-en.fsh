            <p>
                cava belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. cava prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. cava slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
            </p>
            <p>cava is used in adult patients</p>
            <ul>

            <p>See also information under the heading “Do not take cava”.</p>
            <p>You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. cava is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).</p>
            <b>Children and adolescents</b>
            <p>This medicinal product should not be used in children and adolescents because the safety and efficacy have not yet been fully established.</p>
            <b>Other medicines and cava</b>
            <p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p>
            <p>Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions:
                If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take
                cava” and “Warnings and precautions”).</p>

            <b>cava with food and drink</b>
            <p>cava can be taken with or without food.</p>
            <b>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</b>
            <b>Pregnancy</b>
            <p>You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking cava before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of cava. cava is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third month of pregnancy.</p>
            <b>Breast-feeding</b>
            <p>Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. cava is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.</p>
            <b>Driving and using machines</b>
            <p>cava is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment of high blood pressure. If you experience these, talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines.

            <p>The maximal blood pressure lowering effect should be reached 4-6 weeks after beginning treatment.</p>

            <b>Use in children and adolescents</b>
            <p>cava should not be given to children under 18 years of age. If a child swallows some tablets, contact your doctor immediately.</p>

            <p>As with similar medicines, rare cases of allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), as well as localised swelling of the face, lips and/or tongue have been reported in patients taking irbesartan. If you get any of these symptoms or get short of breath, stop taking cava and contact your doctor immediately.</p>

            <p>Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people</p>
            <p>Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people</p>
            <p>Uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people</p>
            <p>Side effects reported in clinical studies for patients treated with cava were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): if you suffer from high blood pressure and
                    type 2 diabetes with kidney disease, blood tests may show an increased level of potassium.</li>
                <li>Common (may affect up to 1 10 people): dizziness, feeling sick/vomiting, fatigue and blood tests may show raised levels of an enzyme that measures the muscle and heart function (creatine kinase enzyme). In patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes with kidney disease, dizziness when getting up from a lying or sitting position, low blood pressure when getting up from a lying or sitting position, pain in joints or muscles and decreased levels of a protein in the red blood cells (haemoglobin) were also reported.
                </li>
                <li>Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): heart rate increased, flushing, cough, diarrhoea, indigestion/heartburn, sexual dysfunction (problems with sexual performance), chest pain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some undesirable effects have been reported since marketing of cava. Undesirable effects where the frequency is not known are: feeling of spinning, headache, taste disturbance, ringing in the ears, muscle cramps, pain in joints and muscles, decreased number of red blood cells (anaemia – symptoms may include tiredness, headaches, being short of breath when exercising, dizziness and looking pale), reduced number of platelets, abnormal liver function, increased blood potassium levels, impaired kidney function, inflammation of small blood vessels mainly affecting the skin (a condition known as leukocytoclastic vasculitis), severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock) and low blood sugar levels. Uncommon cases of jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes) have also been reported.
