        <status value="additional"/><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>cava belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood vessels causing them to tighten. This results in an increase in blood pressure. cava prevents the binding of angiotensin-II to these receptors, causing the blood vessels to relax and the blood pressure to lower. cava slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>cava is used in adult patients</p><ul><li>to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension)</li><li>to protect the kidney in patients with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory evidence of impaired kidney function.</li></ul></div>
